          <h4>What Are Cookies?</h4>
          <p>Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. They are widely used to make websites work more efficiently and provide information to the website owners.</p>

          <h4>My Use of Cookies</h4>
          <p>I use cookies for the sole purpose of improving my understanding of which locations visitors to my website connect from and which sections they visit more often. I do not collect or store any personal information about my website visitors. The only cookies used are provided by Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. These cookies help me analyze how visitors use my site, which in turn allows me to improve it.</p>

          <h5>Google Analytics</h5>
          <p>Google Analytics is a widely-used service that helps website owners understand how their site is performing. It may use cookies to track user interactions on the website. These cookies collect information, such as your IP address, the pages you visit, and the duration of your visit. Google Analytics does not collect personally identifiable information.</p>
          <p>The information generated by the cookies about your use of this website is transmitted to Google. This information is then used to evaluate visitors' use of the website and to compile statistical reports on website activity.</p>
          <p>I use the information provided by Google Analytics to make improvements to my website and to better tailor its content to my visitors.</p>

          <h4>Managing Cookies</h4>
          <p>Most web browsers allow you to control and manage cookies through their settings. You can set your browser to alert you when a cookie is being used, and you can choose to accept or reject the cookie. You can also delete cookies stored on your device.</p>
          <p>Please note that blocking or deleting cookies will not impact any of this website's features and functionality, which are kept rather simplistic anyway.</p>
